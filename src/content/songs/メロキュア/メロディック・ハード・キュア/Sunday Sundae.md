I just wanna be with you on Sunday   
恋をしたの　Sunday　夢見たのも　Sunday   
Don't let me leave alone   
  
Just wanna be with you on Sunday   
ソファーに寝ころんで　ちょっと拗ねてる Sunday   
Don't let me leave alone   
  
I'm in love ＆ That made me like a girlhood   
Yes I don't know why   
  
Just wanna be with you on Sunday   
恋をしたの　Sunday　夢見たのも　Sunday   
Don't let me leave alone   
  
Just wanna be with you   
Just wanna be with you on Sunday   
受話器に手をかけて　ちょっと待ってる　Sunday   
Don't let me leave alone   
  
Break this silence, please   
  
Now I need you.  

<!-- 翻译 -->

I just wanna be with you on Sunday (星期天我只想跟你腻在一块儿)  
我恋爱了　Sunday　也是我所梦想的　Sunday   
Don't let me leave alone (别丢下我一人)  
  
Just wanna be with you on Sunday   
赖在沙发上　闹点小脾气　Sunday   
Don't let me leave alone   
  
I'm in love ＆ That made me like a girlhood (我恋爱了 ＆ 这让我宛如少女)  
Yes I don't know why (你不会知道原因)  
  
Just wanna be with you on Sunday   
我恋爱了　Sunday　也是我所梦想的　Sunday   
Don't let me leave alone   
  
Just wanna be with you   
Just wanna be with you on Sunday   
手放在听筒上　稍等了一下下　Sunday   
Don't let me leave alone   
  
Break this silence, please (请你打破沉默)  
  
Now I need you (此刻我需要你).
